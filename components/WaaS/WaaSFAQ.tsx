                    <p>Normally, your website will be live within four weeks after the start of the assignment, provided you provide the necessary texts and photos. If you do not have this content, we can provide it for you. We can perform this process parallel to the website development, so that your site is online complete with text and content within four weeks.</p>

                    <p>With our WaaS website, you start with a one-time fixed starting fee that covers only 10% of the total costs. After that, you pay a monthly fee that includes not only maintenance and updates, but also the integration of plugins and any improvements to the design. This way, your website will always be provided with the latest features.</p>
